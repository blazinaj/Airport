## Extra Credit

2.	EXTRA CREDIT: Develop a customer UI that allows a customer to:
a.	Find an available seat on a flight and book the available seat.
b.	Find an available cabin on a cruise trip and book the available cabin. Information on cruises A cruise (e.g., the Alaskan Cruise Co.) is associated with a number of trips, where each trip starts on a start-date and ends on an end-date. A trip cannot last more than 21 days. Each trip visits a fixed sequence of ports. Each trip is assigned a ship. Note that a ship can be assigned to more than one trip as long as the trip dates do not overlap. Cabins on a ship are grouped into the following sections: Family (can hold a maximum of 4 persons), Deluxe Family (can hold a maximum of 6 persons), Couples (can hold a maximum of two persons), and Deluxe Couples (can hold a maximum of two persons).

EXTRA CREDIT: Extend your design to support booking of seats on trains, and you will be required to apply the Abstract Factory design pattern to your design. In the train system, there are different train companies (referred to as train lines) that manage trains that run between cities. Each train line has train journeys that stop at cities (i.e., each train journey is associated with a sequence of cities). A train journey has first, business and economy class sections (as in the airline system). Seats in these sections are numbered as in the airline system.
